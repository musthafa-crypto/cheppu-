The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.


In quiet thought and steadfast stride,
Through waves of change, you learn and glide.
With hands that build, with mind that sees,
The world grows brighter, thanks to Ramees.
